# Exam-Score-Predictor
This project predicts a student’s exam score using Linear Regression, focusing on learning core Machine Learning concepts through practical implementation.

## Approach
-Performed basic data analysis and feature selection
-Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model
-Evaluated performance using MSE and R² Score
-Saved the trained model using pickle
-Built an interactive Streamlit app for user input and predictio

## Features Used
- Hours studied
- Previous exam score
- Attendance percentage

## Model Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Application
A simple Streamlit web app allows users to enter inputs and get real-time exam score predictions, demonstrating an end-to-end ML workflow.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

## Key Learnings
-Linear Regression fundamentals
-Loss (MSE) and R² interpretation
-Feature addition and model improvement
-Deploying ML models using Streamlit
